# Web Terminal App üöÄ

## Introduction üëã

Welcome to my project, **Angular Web Terminal**! This project is part of my personal portfolio. I designed and built this to demonstrate my skills and growth as a developer. Here, you'll find details about the project, how to set it up locally, and the technologies I used.

Feel free to check out the [previous live version here](!https://aaron-soto.github.io/tower-defense/) or the code for that project [here](!https://github.com/aaron-soto/tower-defense).

## Project Overview üìñ

This project is a web-based simulator of a traditional terminal interface, built using Angular. It's designed to mimic the behavior of a real terminal without executing actual code. Instead, it responds to a predefined set of custom commands that I've integrated into the application. These commands cover various functionalities such as user authentication, theme customization, and simulated data fetching operations like retrieving weather information.

The application offers an interactive user experience, allowing inputs through keyboard text entries and arrow key selections. This innovative approach not only enhances user engagement but also serves as a unique tool for demonstrating web-based simulations of classic systems. It's an ideal project for exploring the capabilities of Angular in creating dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

List all the technologies, libraries, and tools you used to create the project. This might include:

- **JavaScript**
- **Angular**

## Features ‚ú®

Here are some of the standout features of the project:

- **Command Simulation:** Simulates a real terminal environment by responding to custom predefined commands, providing a realistic terminal experience directly in the browser.

- **User Authentication Commands:** Supports commands related to user authentication, allowing users to simulate login and logout processes.

- **Theme Customization:** Enables users to switch between different visual themes for the terminal, enhancing the user experience and demonstrating dynamic CSS capabilities.

- **Data Fetch Simulation:** Includes example commands for fetching data like current weather conditions, showcasing how to integrate API calls within a simulated terminal environment.

- **Interactive Input Handling:** Accepts user input through text and arrow key selections, providing a tactile and interactive interface similar to an actual terminal.

- **Lightweight and Fast:** Built with performance in mind, ensuring that the simulator is fast and does not burden the browser, even during complex operations.
